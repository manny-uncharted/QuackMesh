# 🦆 QuackMesh: Decentralized AI Training with Privacy & Rewards

> **Winner Project for DuckChain x AWS Hack: AI Unchained** 🏆  
> *Train AI. Protect Privacy. Earn $DUCK.*

## TL;DR

- Decentralized compute marketplace + federated learning.  
  Providers auto-register via authenticated heartbeats and earn $DUCK. Developers rent nodes for training/inference.
- Privacy-by-design: data never leaves the device; only model updates/metrics are shared.
- Works today: Next.js + FastAPI + Solidity on DuckChain, shipped with Docker Compose and CI/CD.
- Smooth Web2→Web3 onboarding: one-click node setup, API key auth, and wallet-gated views.

## Why this wins (at a glance)
- **Privacy-first training** with federated learning and secure aggregation.
- **End-to-end product**: smart contracts, orchestrator, workers, and polished UI.
- **Great UX**: familiar cloud feel; one-click node registration; instant feedback.
- **Real token utility**: pay to rent compute, earn by providing compute/data with $DUCK.
- **Production-ready** infra with AWS, Docker, and GitHub Actions.

## 60-second demo path
1. Connect wallet in the dashboard.  
2. Register your node (one-click script).  
3. Node heartbeats -> status turns Online.  
4. Go to Marketplace, filter, and rent a node.  
5. Watch job progress and rewards accrue.
